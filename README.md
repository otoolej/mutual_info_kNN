# Mutual Information (Matlab code)

Calculate the mutual information using a nearest-neighbours method for both the continuous
versus continuous variable ([Kraskov et al. 2004](#references)) and for the continious versus discrete (binary,
categorical) variable ([Ross 2014](#references)).

For full details, see references ([Kraskov et al. 2004, Ross 2014](#references)).

Use `knnsearch` from the statistics toolbox but replaces `rangesearch` with specific code
for variable distance. Not using `rangesearch` computes a few orders of magnitude faster.

## Requires
Matlab ([Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/)) version R2020a or newer
with the statistics toolbox. (Should work on older versions but not tested.)

## Functions

+ `mi_discrete_cont(x, y, k)` computes the mutual information for continuous variable `x`
and discrete (integer values only) `y`, with `k` nearest neighbours.

+ `mi_cont_cont(x1, x2, k)` computes the mutual information for continuous variables `x1`
and `x2`, with `k` nearest neighbours.

## Example

```matlab
% load an example data set with continuous and discrete variables:
data_tb = readtable('data_cont_discrete_eg.csv');

% plot the data (if needed):
figure(1); clf; hold all;
hl(1) = plot(data_tb.x1);
hl(2) = plot(data_tb.x2);
hl(3) = plot(data_tb.x3);
hl(4) = plot(data_tb.y .* 100);
legend(hl, {'x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'y'});


% set the number of nearest neighbours:
k = 5;

% mutual information between x1(2,3) and the binaray y:
mi_x_y = zeros(1, 3);
mi_x_y(1) = mi_discrete_cont(data_tb.x1, data_tb.y, k);
mi_x_y(2) = mi_discrete_cont(data_tb.x2, data_tb.y, k);
mi_x_y(3) = mi_discrete_cont(data_tb.x3, data_tb.y, k);

% mutual information between the continuous variables:
mi_x_x = zeros(1, 3);
mi_x_x(1) = mi_cont_cont(data_tb.x1, data_tb.x2, k);
mi_x_x(2) = mi_cont_cont(data_tb.x2, data_tb.x3, k);
mi_x_x(3) = mi_cont_cont(data_tb.x1, data_tb.x3, k);

% display output in table:
disp(array2table([mi_x_y; mi_x_x]', 'VariableNames', {'MI (x vs y)', 'MI (x vs x)'}));
```
